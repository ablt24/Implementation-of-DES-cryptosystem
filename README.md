# Implementation-of-DES-cryptosystem
The DES (Data Encryption Standard) cryptosystem is a symmetric-key algorithm used for secure data encryption. It operates on 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key and applies 16 rounds of permutation and substitution. DES uses Feistel structure and is widely studied, though now considered insecure for modern use.
